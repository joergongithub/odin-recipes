<h2>THE WAY TO GO TO BY AS HOT AS THE HOT GUY EATING HOT SAUCE</h2>
<p>With this easy homemade hot sauce you may never have to buy hot sauce again!
</p>
<p>You can make hot sauce from green chilies or red/orange ripe chilies. The main differences will be the color of the sauce, the heat level, sweetness, and flavor of the peppers themselves. </p>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>20 fresh peppers of your choice</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups white vinegar or apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>3 tsp minced fresh garlic</li>
</ul>

<h3>STEPS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Put on gloves (kitchen-safe) and wash the peppers.</li>
<li>Cut the tops off of your peppers and slice in half lengthwise.</li>
<li>Pour the vinegar into a saucepan/pot, add peppers, salt, and garlic. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a low boil until peppers are soft (about 10 minutes).</li>
<li>Pour everything into your blender, including peppers and vinegar.</li>
<li>Blend it (seeds and all) until liquefied.</li>
<li>Add additional heat if desired. If you like it hot, add a Habanero (or half of one), re-blend and re-taste.</li>
<li>Enjoy. You now have hot sauce!</li>

</ol>
